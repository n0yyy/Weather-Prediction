# Weather-Prediction

We attempted to use the Random Forest Algorithm for classification in order to forecast the 
weather in Algorithm. We conducted three experiments using this Algorithm:

-The first research performed leads us to the conclusion that 200 is the optimal n_estimator value. 
Secondly, we have determined that every attribute—temperature_min, temperature_max, wind, 
and precipitation—has equal importance in accurately predicting the weather. 
-And the final experiment shows that the unsorted data will get higher accuracy than the sorted data.
